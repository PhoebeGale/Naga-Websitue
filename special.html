            </div>
            <div class="col-right">
                <p>The name "Naga" is believed to have originated from the word 
                    narra, a type of hardwood tree known for its strength and 
                    resilience. This name was inspired by the abundance of narra 
                    trees that once flourished in the area, shaping not only the 
                    physical landscape but also the identity of the community. 
                    These trees, deeply valued for their durability and beauty, 
                    symbolized the steadfast spirit of Naga's early settlers. 
                    Over time, the name "Naga" became more than just a reference to 
                    its natural environmentâ€”it grew to embody the city's enduring 
                    strength, cultural richness, and historical significance. Today, 
                    while modern development has transformed Naga into an 
                    industrial hub, its name serves as a living reminder of its roots, 
                    connecting its present progress to the natural and cultural 
                    heritage of its past.</p>

                <p>Naga City deeply values faith, resilience, and unity, which are 
                    the cornerstones of its identity as a community. These values 
                    reflect the city's strong sense of togetherness and deep 
                    cultural heritage, nurtured over centuries of shared history and 
                    tradition. Faith plays a central role in the lives of its people, 
                    evident in the enduring devotion to St. Francis of Assisi, the 
                    city's patron saint, and the vibrant celebrations of religious 
                    festivals that bring residents together in joyful harmony. 
                    Resilience, on the other hand, defines the spirit of Naga's 
                    people, who have faced challenges with unwavering 
                    determination and strength. This characteristic has allowed 
                    the city to thrive as an industrial hub while preserving its rich 
                    cultural and natural treasures. Unity ties it all together, 
                    fostering a harmonious community where traditions blend 
                    seamlessly with modern progress. Guided by a commitment to 
                    inclusivity and collaboration, the city continually seeks to 
                    create an environment where people can grow and succeed 
                    while cherishing their shared heritage.</p>

                <p>Naga City is composed of 28 barangays, each playing a vital 
                    role in shaping the city's vibrant culture and dynamic 
                    development. These barangays are more than just 
                    administrative divisions; they are the lifeblood of the city's 
                    governance and community life. Each barangay has its own 
                    unique character, traditions, and contributions, creating a 
                    mosaic of diversity that strengthens the city as a whole. From 
                    the bustling coastal barangays that thrive on trade and fishing 
                    to the serene upland communities known for their natural 
                    beauty and agricultural practices, every barangay brings 
                    something distinct to Naga's identity. Together, they serve as 
                    the foundation of a unified yet diverse city, fostering progress 
                    while preserving the rich heritage and close-knit spirit that 
                    Naga City is known for.</p>
